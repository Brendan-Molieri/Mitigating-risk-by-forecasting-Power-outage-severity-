# Mitigating-risk-by-forecasting-power-outage-severity

### Problems ran into:

One of the issues that I ran into when trying to scrape daily whether data for each power outage, the website utilized a drop box input for selecting date. I was not able to select the date as efficiently as possible. Thus, I analyzed the url structure of the daily date while only inputing the location. I found that the date can be easily edited from this following url must faster and simplier.
